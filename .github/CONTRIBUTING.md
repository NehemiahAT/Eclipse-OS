# Contributing
The Eclipse Development team encourages anyone who wishes to contribute. If you are having trouble with any of the steps below feel free to reach out to one of the Eclipse Development team developers. 

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make with the lead developers of the Eclipse Development Team before making a major change, if possible. 

This is mainly for developers of the Eclipse Development Team but anyone can contribute to the Eclipse OS project as long as they follow the guidelines and steps listed below.
## Pull Request Process
1. Copy the code from the [main.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athaun/Eclipse-OS/master/main.js) file to a [New Program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs) on Khan Academy.
2. Work on any features or changes.
3. Ensure that no commits were made since you last copied the main.js file.
4. Paste your code to the [main.js](https://github.com/athaun/Eclipse-OS/edit/master/main.js) file.
5. Provide an appropriate description for the changes you have made and create your pull request.
6. Update any version number increments throughout the files in the repository.
> Note that if you are working on a major change or feature (anything that doesn't just fix a grammar mistake or adds a couple of lines of code) you should create a new branch.
## Standards
All code must follow the [Code Guidelines](https://github.com/athaun/Eclipse-OS/wiki/Code-Guidelines). Not all features you make will always be kept if the lead developers don't see any value of adding them. 

Refer to the [How to Write a Git Commit](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) guide for best practices when creating a commit.
